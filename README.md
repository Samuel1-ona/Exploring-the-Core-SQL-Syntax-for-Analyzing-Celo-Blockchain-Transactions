# Let's dive into a practical example to demonstrate how to extract information from a Celo transaction using SQL:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Creating a Database:

Once you have executed this SQL command, a new database with the name celo_blockchain will be created in your SQL server. Note that you will need appropriate permissions and access to the SQL server in order to create a new database.

```
CREATE DATABASE celo_blockchain;

```
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Importing the Flat Files ( CSV ) into SQL Server:

1.```file_path``` is the path to the CSV file that you want to import.

2.```Celo_transactions``` is the name of the table where you want to import the data.

3.```FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','``` specifies that the fields in the CSV file are separated by commas.

4.```ENCLOSED BY '"'``` specifies that fields are enclosed by double quotes.

5.```LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'``` specifies that each row is terminated by a new line character.

6.```IGNORE 1 ROWS``` tells the SQL engine to ignore the first row in the CSV file, which is usually a header row.

Here is an example of how you might use this syntax to import data from a CSV file named my_data.csv into a table named my_table:

```
-- This code disables foreign key checks, loads data from a CSV file into the celo_name table, and re-enables foreign key checks.

SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0;    -- This line disables foreign key checks to speed up the loading process and avoid foreign key constraints errors.

LOAD DATA INFILE '/absolute/path/to/my_celo.csv'      -- This loads the data from the specified CSV file into the celo_name table.
INTO TABLE celo_name
CHARACTER SET utf8        -- This specifies the character set of the CSV file to be UTF-8.
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','   -- This specifies that the fields in the CSV file are separated by commas.
ENCLOSED BY '"'     -- This specifies that fields that contain commas are enclosed in double quotes.
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'   -- This specifies that each line in the CSV file ends with a newline character.
IGNORE 1 ROWS        -- This specifies that the first row of the CSV file should be ignored as it usually contains the header.

ERRORS;        -- This line specifies that any errors encountered during the load process should be displayed as warnings and the loading process should continue.

SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 1;        -- This line re-enables foreign key checks after the loading process is complete.


```
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Calling the Table from the Database:

```SELECT * FROM Celo_transactions;```



In this syntax,```Celo_transactions``` is the name of the table you want to select data from. The ```*``` symbol specifies that you want to select all columns from the table



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





* ## Let's say we have a Celo_transactions table with the following columns: ```transaction_id```, ```sender_address```, ```receiver_address```, ```amount```, ```gas_fee```, and ```transaction_date```. The goal is to analyze a specific transaction and extract relevant information.

*  ## Find transaction details for a specific transaction ID:

The purpose of this query is to extract the details of a specific transaction identified by its unique transaction ID. By executing this query, you will obtain all the information available for that particular transaction, including the sender address, receiver address, amount transferred, gas fee, and transaction date.

Note that when using this query, ensure to replace 'your_transaction_id' with the actual transaction ID value you want to analyze to get the desired results.

``` 
-- To extract details for a specific transaction, you can use the following SQL query:

SELECT *  -- This statement selects all columns from the table.

FROM Celo_transactions  -- Specifies the table from which to retrieve the data 

WHERE transaction_id = 'your_transaction_id'; -- This condition filters the rows based on the transaction_id column.

```

* ## Calculate the total amount transferred in the transaction:

By executing this query and replacing 'your_transaction_id' with the actual transaction ID you want to analyze, you will get the total amount associated with that transaction. This can be useful in determining the overall value transferred in a particular transaction.

It's important to note that the SUM() function is used here assuming that the amount column contains numerical values representing the transaction amounts. Adjust the query accordingly if the column data type or the purpose of the amount column is different in your specific scenario. 


```
-- To calculate the total amount transferred in a transaction, you can use the following query:

SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_amount -- This statement calculates the sum of the amount column for the selected transaction and assigns it an alias of total_amount. 

FROM Celo_transactions              -- Specifies the table from which to retrieve the data 

WHERE transaction_id = 'your_transaction_id';   -- This condition filters the rows based on the transaction_id column.


```
* ## Calculate the maximum amount transferred in the transaction:

Now, let's focus on the``` MAX()``` function:

The ```MAX()``` function is an aggregate function in SQL that returns the maximum value from a given column. It is used to perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. In this code, the MAX() function is applied to the "amount" column, and it retrieves the highest value among all the values in that column. By using the MAX() function, we can easily find the maximum amount associated with the specified transaction ID.

```
-- To calculate the maximum amount transferred in a transaction, you can use the following query:

SELECT MAX(amount) AS maximum_amount -- This statement calculates the maximum of the amount column for the selected transaction and assigns it an alias of maximum_amount. 

FROM Celo_transactions              -- Specifies the table from which to retrieve the data 

WHERE transaction_id = 'your_transaction_id';   -- This condition filters the rows based on the transaction_id column.


```

* ## Calculate the minimum amount transferred in the transaction:


Now, let's focus on the MIN() function:

The ```MIN()``` function is an aggregate function in SQL that returns the minimum value from a given column. It is used to calculate and retrieve the smallest value among a set of values. In this code, the MIN() function is applied to the "amount" column, and it retrieves the lowest value among all the values in that column. By using the MIN() function, we can easily find the minimum amount associated with the specified transaction ID.

```
-- To calculate the minimum amount transferred in a transaction, you can use the following query:

SELECT MIN(amount) AS Minimum_amount -- This statement calculates the Minimum of the amount column for the selected transaction and assigns it an alias of maximum_amount. 

FROM Celo_transactions              -- Specifies the table from which to retrieve the data 

WHERE transaction_id = 'your_transaction_id';   -- This condition filters the rows based on the transaction_id column.


```


* ## Determine the ```gas_fee``` paid for the transaction:

By executing this query and replacing 'your_transaction_id' with the actual transaction ID you want to analyze, you will obtain the gas fee associated with that transaction. Gas fees are the charges paid by users to execute transactions on the Celo blockchain and are typically denoted in the blockchain's native currency.

Please note that the column name gas_fee assumes that the Celo_transactions table contains a column named gas_fee that stores the gas fee values for each transaction. Adjust the query if the column name or structure is different in your specific scenario.


```
-- To find the gas_fee paid for a specific transaction, you can use the following query:

SELECT gas_fee   -- This statement specifies the column gas_fee that you want to retrieve from the table. It indicates that you are interested in obtaining the gas fee associated with the transaction.

FROM Celo_transactions  --   Specifies the table from which to retrieve the data 

WHERE transaction_id = 'your_transaction_id'; -- This condition filters the rows based on the transaction_id column.


```

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Time functions used in Querying Celo Blockchain:

* Analyze transactions within a specific date range:

To use this query effectively, replace 'start_date' and 'end_date' with the actual dates you want to use as the range for filtering the transactions. Make sure to follow the correct date format expected by the database system.

By executing this query with the appropriate start and end dates, you will obtain all the transactions that occurred within the specified date range from the Celo_transactions table. This can be useful for analyzing transactions over a specific period or extracting data for a particular time frame.

Note that the * symbol in the SELECT statement selects all columns. If you only need specific columns, you can replace * with the desired column names separated by commas.


```
To analyze transactions within a specific date range, you can use the following query:

SELECT *   -- This statement selects all columns from the table.

FROM Celo_transactions -- Specifies the table from which to retrieve the data 

WHERE transaction_date >= 'start_date' AND transaction_date <= 'end_date';  -- This condition filters the rows based on the transaction_date column. It selects only the rows where the transaction date is greater than or equal to the specified start date and less than or equal to the specified end date.


```



These examples demonstrate how you can extract specific information from Celo transactions using SQL queries. By modifying the queries based on your analysis requirements, you can gain insights into transaction data, such as specific transaction details, total amounts transferred, gas fees, and analyzing transactions within a specific date range.
